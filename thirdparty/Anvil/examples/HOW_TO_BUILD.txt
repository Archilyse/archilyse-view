Q: How can I run any of the included examples?
A: Let us say you are interested in running the "OutOfOrderRasterization" example.
   To build it:

1. Go to the examples\OutOfOrderRasterization directory.
2. Create a "build" directory.
3. From there, issue:

cmake -G "Your IDE of choice" ..

4. In the "build" directory, a project/solution file, supported by your IDE,
   should have been created. Open it, build the project, and you should be good
   to run it.
